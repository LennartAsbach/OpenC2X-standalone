COMMON
- Remove mMac from GlobalConfig when mStationID is used everywhere as ID

CAM
- Get rid of mLastSentCam in CaService
- Config for high frequency container: basic vehicle/ RSU


Meeting:
1) Hardcoded GeoNetworking header: Only look for very specific bits to identify CAM or DENM and that is it. Even geo location sent in header is not accurate.
2) Separate config for CAMs from RSU and OBU. 
3) Hardcoded CAMs. Link them to GPS, OBD2
4) Internally everything works with protobuffers.
5) DENM
6) Cmake projects
7) Wiki article for using ETSI stack on cohda

Any specific TODOs before mid/ end of November?
